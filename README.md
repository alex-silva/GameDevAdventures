Functional games that were on the way of development and may look sketchy

## Bitprobe
A functional game about a probe that was going to save the world from digital madness or anything like that.

Bitprobe was developed by:
- [Alexandre Briskieviez Silva](https://github.com/alex-silva) (code)
- [Leandro Duque Mussio](https://github.com/lmussio/) (code)
- [Pedro Bruno Oliva](https://github.com/XxPBOSSxX) (art)

It may see the light of day, someday.
